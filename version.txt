### Highlights - Advanced Web Auth
Improved web authentication module now supports 3 different modes:
1. General auth with no special permissions (as before)
2. General auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.
3. Preliminary auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.

Renewed auth logic now allows you to control which permissions to request from which auth groups, i.e. which data EVE Online characters will share with you upon authentication.
By default this feature is disabled and new users will only pass basic auth as before. But if you fill *ESICustomAuthRoles* param (mode 2) then bot will get a refresh token from character during auth process.
This refresh token will be stored in a database and will be used to fetch all required data about registered characters. You can also set *PreliminaryAuthMode* (mode 3) to force applicants to wait for an approval 
making it possible to inspect them using "JackKnife" utility named **HRM** before they're allowed into your corporation or alliance.

NOTE: Refresh token can be invalidated by user at any time in their EVE Online account settings
NOTE: You have to add all required ESI permissions to your CCP app before you can use them in auth process

Considering the above you can build your own "JackKnife" recruitment process for selected group as following:
1. Create auth group with *PreliminaryAuthMode* set to true. This will force group to accept all auth requests and enable refresh token extraction. All appllicants will be put on hold for consequent actions.
2. An applicant should confirm his registration in Discord using *!auth confirm CODE* command displayed during their auth process. This is needed to bind their registration to Discord account.
3. Now the data from the applicants will be available for review in the HRM Module web page.
4. Decision:
  - If you decide to accept member then just invite him to your corporation and the bot will automatically auth applicant in Discord based on *CorpIDList* and *AllianceIDList* params. Make sure to set correct *MemberRoles* param to apply Discord roles upon successful registration.
  - If you decide to decline application you can set *AppInvalidationInHours* param which will delete applications when specified amount of hours has passed, decline them manually in HRM module or by using *!auth decline CODE/ID* command.
