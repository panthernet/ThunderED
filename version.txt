### Breaking Changes

WebAuthModule settings undergone following refactoring:
- Removed **CorpIDList, AllianceIDList** and **memberRoles** params
- Added **AllowedAlliances** and **AllowedCorporations** dictionaries with corp and alliance entities inside. **Id** = corp/ally ID and **DiscordRoles** to a list of Discord roles to assign upon successful auth
- !auth command currently displays web site main page and is similar to !web command
- General Discord auth button name now can be changed using the **CustomButtonText** parameter
- Added ManualAssignmentRoles param to AuthGroup which contains Discord roles which can be granted manually but will be stripped if character leave group corp/ally
This will now allow different corps and alliances to auth using a single button but receive different Discord roles based on their corp/ally ID.

WARNING! Auth check logic has also been altered. Previously it could search for user corp/ally ID match in ANY auth group regardless of mode (preliminary or not). 
Now it will first look if user have its auth group remembered in DB (has done auth with ESI permsission specified) and use this group data for check.
If group hasn't been found (removed from file?) or user don't have token (has done auth without ESI permissions) it will search user corp/ally ID match in all auth groups without
ESI permissions. If no corp/ally ID match found the user will be stripped of roles and will require proceed with new auth. 
This is made to maintain check consistency between several different auth groups.
CONCLUSION: maintain actual auth groups in your settings file

 - Labels, Senders props removed
 - Channel property renamed to DefaultChannel and used when FeedChannel isn't specified
 - Added Filters list with the underlying FilterLabels, FilterSenders, FilterMailList and FeedChannel settings

### Highlights - Advanced Web Auth
Improved web authentication module now supports 3 different modes:
1. General auth with no special permissions (as before)
2. General auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.
3. Preliminary auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.

Renewed auth logic now allows you to control which permissions to request from which auth groups, i.e. which data EVE Online characters will share with you upon authentication.
By default this feature is disabled and new users will only pass basic auth as before. But if you fill *ESICustomAuthRoles* param (mode 2) then bot will get a refresh token from character during auth process.
This refresh token will be stored in a database and will be used to fetch all required data about registered characters. You can also set *PreliminaryAuthMode* (mode 3) to force applicants to wait for an approval 
making it possible to inspect them using "JackKnife" utility named **HRM** before they're allowed into your corporation or alliance.

NOTE: Refresh token can be invalidated by user at any time in their EVE Online account settings
NOTE: You have to add all required ESI permissions to your CCP app before you can use them in auth process

Considering the above you can build your own "JackKnife" recruitment process for selected group as following:
1. Create auth group with *PreliminaryAuthMode* set to true. This will force group to accept all auth requests and enable refresh token extraction. All appllicants will be put on hold for consequent actions.
2. An applicant should confirm his registration in Discord using *!auth confirm CODE* command displayed during their auth process. This is needed to bind their registration to Discord account.
3. Now the data from the applicants will be available for review in the HRM Module web page.
4. Decision:
  - If you decide to accept member then just invite him to your corporation and the bot will automatically auth applicant in Discord based on *CorpIDList* and *AllianceIDList* params. Make sure to set correct *MemberRoles* param to apply Discord roles upon successful registration.
  - If you decide to decline application you can set *AppInvalidationInHours* param which will delete applications when specified amount of hours has passed, decline them manually in HRM module or by using *!auth decline CODE/ID* command.
