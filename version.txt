+ Added web server status reporter, new param `ServerStatusPort`. Query specified port to get status (no response - bot is not running). Set to 0 to disable.
+ Added web server `NoStatusResponseOnDiscordDisconnection` param to not respond on status queries if Discord id not connected. Act like bot is not running.
+ Added ability to assign roles to members without corp titles
+ Added new config property `UseSingleFileForLogging` to enable logging into single file
+ Added new property to log feeder `SendInterval` which is default to 5000 msec
+ Greatly improved and refactored web auth module for better maintenance and performance
+ Greatly improved log feeder for better coverage, less CPU and network utilization
+ Colorized important log feeder posts (desktop Discord client only)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Added new entries to `Resources` config section
- Replaced `SystemLogFeederSettings.OnlyErrors` with `SystemLogFeederSettings.LogSeverity`
- Renamed web auth group `UseStrictAuthenticationMode` to ``
- New rules to follow for auth setup:
  - Auth groups will be checked by their order in config file: top to bottom. Independent of the auth type (general, standing, titles, etc.).
  - Allowed members in auth groups will be checked from top to bottom with the following priority: character, corporation, alliance
  - Guest groups should go last in the list or they will be chosen before latter groups
  - Guest groups must have empty `Entities` list (no more 0)!
  - `StopSearchingOnFirstMatch` now properly limits the search. If it is `false` when all members within a single group will be checked. This will allow to assign roles to user from multiple `AllowedMembers` entries matching the criteria. If mentioned  property is `true` then only the first matching entry will be used to grant roles. The same rules applies to standings auth.
  - If user matches several criteria within the group and they contain `Titles`: only the 1st found entry with `Titles` auth will be selected and all other matches will be omitted

+ Redesigned, improved and enhanced LiveKillFeedModule (read below)
+ Redesigned `WebAuthModule` to use new entity system allowing both names and IDs to be specified in corresponding properties

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT - KILL FEEDS
`LiveKillFeedModule` now hosts `RadiusKillFeedModule` module functionality. It is also has been significantly improved to provide agile filtering.
On top of the existing features now you can:
 - Setup detailed filters using the `entity` system where both ID and names are allowed
 - Filter by victim ship type list
 - Filter by SOLO, GROUP, AWOX, NOTAWOX, PVP, PVE tags
 - Filter by attackers and victims separately
 - Filter by maximum KM isk value
 - Exclude any entity from search by specifying leading `-` sign
 - Redirect feed to multiple channels for every filter
 - Choose inclusive or exclusive filtering modes
 - Specify custom template filename for feed Group to use

 Read https://github.com/panthernet/ThunderED/wiki/Killmails-Feed for details.

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT - CORP TITLES AUTH
It is now possible to authenticate characters by assigned corporation titles. Look for `Mode7_AuthByTitles` in default config file.
Several rules:
 - Titles auth is only enabled when `Titles` property within `AllowedMembers` group is not empty
 - Auth group must fetch `esi-characters.read_titles.v1` ESI permission from users
 - `DiscordRoles` property from `AllowedMembers` will be ignored
 - Corp directors will not be authenticated as they don't have corp titles

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT - UPGRADE/DOWNGRADE WEB AUTH GROUPS
You can now specify a list of additional group names for auth group in an `UpgradeGroupNames` and `DowngradeGroupNames` properties. These groups will be checked during an auth check pass. 
- Upgrade: If user will match a group from the list it will be transferred to this auth group. Discord roles will be assigned according to the new group rules.
- Downgrade: If user do not match it's current group criteria he will be checked against all groups in the list and will be transferred to first group that is matching criteria.  Discord roles will be assigned according to the new group rules.

Note that if new group has ESI permissions specified the user will not have them this way. Moreover ESI permissions obtained from previous groups will be maintained.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Bot has been updated to .NET Core 2.2 so you might have to adjust your environment
- Removed `RadiusKillFeedModule` and corresponding settings. Its functionality has been merged into `LiveKillFeedModule`
- Redesigned `LiveKillFeedModule` settings section, please take a look and update
- Contracts cache will be flushed to correct some inconsistencies. First contracts check will fill the cache.
- WebAuth module: 
  - Replaced `AllowedCharacters`, `AllowedCorporations`, `AllowedAlliances` with `AllowedMembers`

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT - MANUAL DISCORD ROLES
It is now possible for users to self assign/remove Discord roles from the predefined list.
Enable this feature in `CommandsConfig` using `EnableRoleManagementCommands` parameter and set roles list using the `RolesCommandDiscordRoles` parameter.
Use `RolesCommandAllowedRoles` to specify Discord roles eligible for these commands. Leave empty to allow everyone.

+ Improved **radiusKillFeedModule** to accept all IDs and names in a single mixed list
+ Improved **timersModule** to accept all IDs and names in a single mixed list
+ Improved **TED_ConfigEditor** to correctly work with mixed lists
+ Removed duplicate mails from spy feeds

### HIGHLIGHTS
- Introducing global quality of life improvement - parameters which accept mixed arrays of IDs and names. Previously there was only strong typed arrays with faceless ID values.
Now I will gradually update modules to accept both names and IDs in a condensed number af params. This will reduce clutter, improve usability and readability of config files.
Before: 
    "accessList": {
      "UnitedFleet":{
        "AllianceIDs": [123],
        "CharacterIDs": [456],
        "CorporationIDs": [789,911]
      }
    },
After:
    "accessList": {
      "UnitedFleet":{
        "FilterEntities": [123, "John Snow", "a:Goonswarm Federation", "c:Corporation"],
      }
    },
Note the **a:* and **c:** prefixes, they are needed to search for alliance or corporation. If no prefix is specified then system will search for character.
Also not that system can search for corporations and alliances by TICKER!
System, constellation and region names do not require prefixes as they're unique by default.

### NOTES
- New **SpyFilters** config param in **HRMModule** section allows you to filter your spies output
- New **DisplayDetailsSummary** param for MailModule filter
- New **DisplayMailDetailsSummary** param for HRMModule filter
- Several notes about Spies HR improvements.
  - You can now disable default mail feed by setting **DefaultSpiesMailFeedChannelId** to 0.
  - You can selectively enable and redirect mail feed by adding filters to **SpyFilters** collection
  - New filters use EVE names instead of IDs which improves config readability while not impacting general performance
  - Mail now can display summary blocks after the message which include EVE urls for fits and channels. You can paste these urls into **EVE MAIL** body to become readable inside the game.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Renamed **SpiesMailFeedChannelId** config param to **DefaultSpiesMailFeedChannelId**
- Removed **RadiusSystemId**,**RadiusConstellationId**,**RadiusRegionId**,**RadiusChannel** from **radiusKillFeedModule**
- Added **radiusChannels** and **radiusEntities** to **radiusKillFeedModule**
- Added **FilterEntities**,**FilterDiscordRoles** to **timersModule** access lists. Removed old parameters.

### V1.3.4
+ Added new **BindToMainCharacter** param to AuthGroups (read explanation below)
+ Added new **IsAltUsersVisible**, **CanInspectAltUsers** and **CanRestoreDumped** params to HR module access list
+ Added ability to restore members from dump in HR module
+ Added new experimental !caps command to display capital skills stats throughout the members database
+ Fixed corp and alliance data update in HR lists when users changes them
+ Fixed contracts type filter
+ Refactored authentication code to be more consistent with the modules
+ Updated HR module to include Alt Characters information into general lists and char inspection page

### NOTES
- Added new mode for the authentication process called: Alt Characters Authentication! In this mode you can bind alt characters with custom ESI permissions to the already authed main characters. Alt characters are dependant from the main character i.e. will be deleted if main character auth is deleted. They can be inspected in HR module and will be a subject for a subset of some new Discord commands.
  When this mode is enabled it will always be treated as if **ExcludeFromOneButtonMode** and **SkipDiscordAuthPage** params are set to true
  Set **BindToMainCharacter** to enable this mode. Please take a look at the auth group named **Mode6_AltCharactersAuth** in **settings.def.json** file for more info.
- Added new experimental **!caps** command to display information about capital ship drivers on channel/server.
  This command uses new settings section: **CommandsConfig** and new config file **shipdata.def.json** which will be automaticaly unfold into **shipdata.json**.
  **CapsCommandDiscordRoles** - list of Discord roles who has access to this command (empty = all)
  **CapsCommandDiscordChannels** - list of Discord channels where this command is allowed (empty = everywhere)

### ADDITIONS
- New config section **CommandsConfig**
- Many new language entries
- New **IsAltUsersVisible** and **CanInspectAltUsers** params to HR module access list
- New **BindToMainCharacter** param for AuthGroups

### V1.3.3
+ Added new **UseStrictAuthenticationMode** param to auth group (read explanation below)
+ Added new **week(w), lastweek(lw), lastday(ld), rating(r)** command parameters for !stats command
+ Added new **ExcludeFromOneButtonMode** param to auth group to avoid being search when **UseOneAuthButton** is enabled
+ Added new **dateFormat** param to Config section
+ Added new **RatingModeChannelId** param to StatsModule and **IncludeInRating** param to Stats groups to autopost rating message

+ Improved auth checks to delete applying members with invalidated tokens
+ Improved ZKB sockets cleanup and restart
+ Fixed !stats d command to not include losses to npc
+ Fixed type filtering for contracts feeder
+ Fixed simplified auth empty line handling
+ Simplified web server settings (read breaking changes below)
+ Moved **Templates/Messages** templates to **Data** directory under Linux (read breaking changed below)

### NOTES
- **helpStat** language entry has been updated

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Auth process checks will now search criterias through several filters within one group by default. This means that the process will now gather all roles that match characters ID, corp ID and alliance ID in **AllowedCharacters, AllowedCorporations** and **AllowedAlliances** filters.
  New **UseStrictAuthenticationMode** param has been introduced which is false by default. When enabled it will force auth process to act as before and stop after the first matching criteria is found.
- Removed **WebListenIP** and **WebListenPort** params from **WebServerModule** config section. Internal port will now always be similar to **WebExternalPort** and internal IP address will now always be 0.0.0.0. This IP will force app under Linux and Windows to listen all local interfaces.
- The bot will now search for **Templates/Messages** templates in  **Data/Templates/Messages** directory under Linux


### V1.3.2
+ Added optional **SkipDiscordAuthPage** param to auth groups to be able to store ESI token and skip Discord auth
+ Added unit tests project
+ Added means to counter Linux data location problems (explanation below)
+ Added delete member buttons to HRM main page
+ Added filters for member lists on main HRM page
+ Added **UseDumpForMembers** and **DumpInvalidationInHours** params to HRM module config
+ Added new Spies list for HR members. Dumped members can be marked as Spies to avoid being recycled.
+ Added new SovTrackerModule (read highlight section below)
+ Added new **clist** command to list contracts for specified group
+ Added new simplified auth management file (read highlight section below)
+ Added new auth param to use only one button for authentication **UseOneAuthButton**
+ Added support for BR web compression
+ Added **SpiesMailFeedChannelId** to be able to feed new mail for characters marked as spies
+ Enhanced HRM module access options and security (explanation below)
+ Removed Discord mention from language file entry **mailMsgTitle**
+ Removed default text for **authPageHeaderText** language string
+ Changed default MySQL collation to utf8mb4_general_ci
+ Improved HTML templating and unified CSS+JS includes
+ Updated SQLite to work in WAL mode
+ Fixed incorrect solar systems table name in some queries

### HIGHLIGHTS

- One auth button mode can be enabled by setting **UseOneAuthButton** param to true. In this case the bot will search for first group which satisfies member corp/alliance condition.
  There is also a change in auth process wotkflow which force users to authenticate twice if found auth group contains ESI permissions.
  In this case automatic redrects are used so user logs in once and select character twice.

- Added new SovTrackerModule which now allows to track sov space holder changes and ADM index falls beyond the threshold in the filtered sets of solar systems.
  Systems can be filtered by ID, holder alliance, region ID and constellation ID. All filters are ADDITIVE.
  !!!WARNING - this module can be very resourse consuming so please read folowing recommendations.
  1. Specifying **HolderAlliances** param will search through 5k+ entries for holder changes on each check (up to 8-10 sec processing on good PC if not prefiltered by **Systems**).
  2. Specifying **Regions** or **Constellations** will force bot to fetch system data for each entry which
  3. Recommended **CheckIntervalInMinutes** is 30+ minutes to avoid exscessive stress
  4. Additive filter hierarchy: **Systems -> HolderAlliances -> Regions -> Constellations**. The most efficient way to setup this module is to specify Systems only.

- Added an ability to read and inject authentication data from standalone file named **_simplifiedAuth.txt**.
  This file holds auth data in a compact CSV-like manner which can be helpful for less IT skilled admins or people who manage access right quite often.
  In this file all entities are identified by names instead of numeric IDs which are then looked up on ESI during the bot startup.
  Specified auth data will be injected into auth groups during runtime. You can even end up with empty predefined auth groups in settings.json file.
  All fields are | delimeted, Discord roles are comma delimited.
  Format: Exact Alliance or Corp or Character name|exact auth group name from config file|Discord role1,Discord role2
  Example1: Starlane Limited|PrelimAlly|Members,[UF]
  Example2: Goonswarm Federation|GuestAuthGroup|GuestRole,TempRole

  You can edit this file and use !rehash command to apply changes right away

### BREAKING CHANGES
- To counter multiple problems with config and logs location under Linux we now search all sensitive data under folder named **Data** in bot root directory.
  Sensitive data is represented by config file, db file and log files. Linux users now **should** use Docker **mount** and Linux **link** commands to mount 
  **Data** folder into the app directory.

  In the following example we mount **/opt/thunder** directory to **Data** folder.
  EXAMPLE:
 ** mkdir /opt/thunder**
 copy settings.json into newly created folder
 ** docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /opt/thunder:/app/ThunderED/Data thundered:latest**

  **WARNING!!!** Param named **Database.DatabaseFile** should now contain only DB filename without a path to avoid errors

- Introduced **AccessLists** param for HRMModule which now allows advanced access distribution. 
  Now you can:
  - Limit access and display of specific user groups for certain roles and characters
  - Limit access for certain roles and characters to members authed under specific group 
  - Limit access for certain roles and characters to members of specific corps and alliances
  - Limit features access

  EXAMPLE:
    "AccessList": {
      "accessList1": {
        "UsersAccessList": [],
        "RolesAccessList": [],
        "AuthGroupNamesFilter": [],
        "AuthAllianceIdFilter": [],
        "AuthCorporationIdFilter": [],
        "ApplyGroupFilterToAwaitingUsers":  false,
        "IsAwaitingUsersVisible": true,
        "IsDumpedUsersVisible": true,
		"IsAuthedUsersVisible": true,
        "IsSpyUsersVisible":  true,
        "CanSearchMail":  true, 
        "CanKickUsers":  true,
        "CanMoveToSpies":  true,
        "CanInspectAuthedUsers":  true,
        "CanInspectAwaitingUsers":  true,
        "CanInspectDumpedUsers":  true,
        "CanInspectSpyUsers":  true

      } 
    },

	**NOTE**: For fast migration to new layout just copy **UsersAccessList** and **RolesAccessList** content to corresponding params

	**UsersAccessList** and **RolesAccessList** acts as before limiting authentication access.
	**AuthGroupNamesFilter**, **AuthAllianceIdFilter** and **AuthCorporationIdFilter** filters are additive. They are used to limit HR user access
	  to view distinct members. Members are identified by their auth group name, alliance ID or corp ID according to mentioned params.
	**ApplyGroupFilterToAwaitingUsers** will apply group name filtering to members awaiting auth (which is off by default)
	**Is_____UsersVisible** gain access to members list of the specific section
	**CanSearchMail** gain access to mail search functions
	**CanKickUsers** gain access to ban hammer
	**CanMoveToSpies** gain access to make-a-spy button for dumped users
	**CanInspect____Users** gain access to detailed info about members of the specific section

### Breaking Changes

WebAuthModule settings undergone following refactoring:
- Removed **CorpIDList, AllianceIDList** and **memberRoles** params
- Added **AllowedAlliances** and **AllowedCorporations** dictionaries with corp and alliance entities inside. **Id** = corp/ally ID and **DiscordRoles** to a list of Discord roles to assign upon successful auth
- !auth command currently displays web site main page and is similar to !web command
- General Discord auth button name now can be changed using the **CustomButtonText** parameter
- Added ManualAssignmentRoles param to AuthGroup which contains Discord roles which can be granted manually but will be stripped if character leave group corp/ally
This will now allow different corps and alliances to auth using a single button but receive different Discord roles based on their corp/ally ID.

WARNING! Auth check logic has also been altered. Previously it could search for user corp/ally ID match in ANY auth group regardless of mode (preliminary or not). 
Now it will first look if user have its auth group remembered in DB (has done auth with ESI permsission specified) and use this group data for check.
If group hasn't been found (removed from file?) or user don't have token (has done auth without ESI permissions) it will search user corp/ally ID match in all auth groups without
ESI permissions. If no corp/ally ID match found the user will be stripped of roles and will require proceed with new auth. 
This is made to maintain check consistency between several different auth groups.
CONCLUSION: maintain actual auth groups in your settings file

 - Labels, Senders props removed
 - Channel property renamed to DefaultChannel and used when FeedChannel isn't specified

### Highlights - Advanced Web Auth
Improved web authentication module now supports 3 different modes:
1. General auth with no special permissions (as before)
2. General auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.
3. Preliminary auth with special ESI permissions requested from group applicant. Creates separate auth button on web server.

Renewed auth logic now allows you to control which permissions to request from which auth groups, i.e. which data EVE Online characters will share with you upon authentication.
By default this feature is disabled and new users will only pass basic auth as before. But if you fill *ESICustomAuthRoles* param (mode 2) then bot will get a refresh token from character during auth process.
This refresh token will be stored in a database and will be used to fetch all required data about registered characters. You can also set *PreliminaryAuthMode* (mode 3) to force applicants to wait for an approval 
making it possible to inspect them using "JackKnife" utility named **HRM** before they're allowed into your corporation or alliance.

NOTE: Refresh token can be invalidated by user at any time in their EVE Online account settings
NOTE: You have to add all required ESI permissions to your CCP app before you can use them in auth process

Considering the above you can build your own "JackKnife" recruitment process for selected group as following:
1. Create auth group with *PreliminaryAuthMode* set to true. This will force group to accept all auth requests and enable refresh token extraction. All appllicants will be put on hold for consequent actions.
2. An applicant should confirm his registration in Discord using *!auth confirm CODE* command displayed during their auth process. This is needed to bind their registration to Discord account.
3. Now the data from the applicants will be available for review in the HRM Module web page.
4. Decision:
  - If you decide to accept member then just invite him to your corporation and the bot will automatically auth applicant in Discord based on *CorpIDList* and *AllianceIDList* params. Make sure to set correct *MemberRoles* param to apply Discord roles upon successful registration.
  - If you decide to decline application you can set *AppInvalidationInHours* param which will delete applications when specified amount of hours has passed, decline them manually in HRM module or by using *!auth decline CODE/ID* command.
